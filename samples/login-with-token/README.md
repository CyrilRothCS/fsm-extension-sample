# Login with token extension sample

Login with token extension is a minimalist sample of a login extension performed with a backend authentication mechanism.

## How to run

### Run locally

Install dependency `npm install` then run server with `npm start`.

#### Publicly accessible

For testing purpose, an external solution like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [localtunnel](https://github.com/localtunnel/localtunnel) can provide a publicly accessible url that will proxy all requests to your locally running webserver.
